# APPLICATION NAME
This application is called "Photo Editor" and features nine very simple pixel manipulation edits for pictures taken within the app. I expect it to be used mostly by me, showing people what I made, but in a larger sense it could be used, by me or other beginner application developers, as a stepping stone for creating future photo editing applications. Its purpose was not only to serve the assignment, but also to help me to learn some larger features of mobile app development such as multiple screen views.

## System Design 
This application was created for Andoird version 7.0 and above and was debugged on a Samsung Galxy S7 Edge. However, I believe it will run on recent previous versions such as 6.0 and above. The application is lightweight and will run even on outdated, weak hardware. 


## Usage
Usage of the Photo Editor is very simple. The first screen of the application allows the user to open the camera and take a photo. The user is then moved to the editor screen where they are prompted with 9 options: remove red, remove blue, remove green, negate red, negate blue, negate green, grayscale, add noise, and high contrast. Each option can be used to manipulate the RGB values of the picture on the screen. Only one option can be used at a time, but after picking an option, picking another option will still bring up an edited version of the original photo.
