# APPLICATION NAME
For project 1, I created a simple postfix calculator purely to meet the homework requirement. However, in another sense, it has also served to make me feel a sort of "level-up" in terms of programming, having made something that I can actually run on my phone and send to my friends. It won't be useful to anyone I know, but it's certianly a point of pride in terms of making something functional.

## System Design 
My application was created for Android OS 7.1 or higher using a Nexus 6 emulator. Any recent Android device will run it no problem. Its use is fairly limited, as it can only handle two numbers at a time, and there isn't much demand for postfix calculators out in the world, but it uses less than 50 MB of RAM to run.

## Usage
To use my application, you enter a number or operation and then hit the enter key to store it. It can only work if you hit a number, then enter, then another number, then enter again, and then the operation. It will only work with two numbers, however the numbers can be as big or as small as you want. Any number that is the result of an operation can also be stored by hitting the enter key again after the result has been calculated and displayed to the screen.
