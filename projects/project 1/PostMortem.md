# Post Mortem

I really enjoyed working on this first application. This was my first time ever working with mobile application development and I learned a lot, not only about the process but about working with C# as well. So far, I really like the differences C# has when compared to C++, like some of the built-in functions it has such as TryParse which allowed me to grab and store the information that was inputted to my calculator. There is a different feeling of accomplishment to be had from creating something a little more tangible, like an application, than there is when creating a program in C++. It is not necessarily a better feeling of accomplishment, merely a different one. That in itself was a nice change of pace from the usual program creation we tend to do in Computer Science courses. 

I think the most difficult part of the assignment was trying to figure out how to make my ‘Enter’ key work on the calculator. Before I found out about TryParse, I found myself stumped conceptually on how to make one button perform so many different operations on the information I had entered, as well as add that information into a stack so that I could store it for later use. Using TryParse, I was able to take the entered information, convert the numbers to data type doubles, store them in the stack, and pop them off for use in my operations. Speaking off popping them off, a difference between C# and C++ that I found interesting was that I could get the value and datatype of an element in a stack just by setting a variable equal to popping the stack. Unlike C++, I didn’t have to use top to get the value and then pop to get rid of it, I could just use pop to do both.

I think in the future I would like to revisit this postfix calculator application and make it more functional and complex than it is now. I would want to add the ability to use more than just two numbers and one operation for calculations, allowing for more complex entries. I would also like to increase usability by adding more than just the four basic operations for calculation, adding in buttons to square numbers, take the square roots of numbers, and much more.
