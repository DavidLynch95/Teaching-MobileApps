I did not do very much work for PA4, having set out to improve the three previous applications and ultimately changing only PA3. I am very happy with the way PA3 works now, however I would have liked to do much more with it, having come up with ideas for drastically changing the user interface now that the application works better than when I first finished it. Originally, I finished the assignment (PA3) with the starting code we were given before the high resolution and gallery saving code bits were added so the application worked but not very well. Now however, with those bits of code added, it is much more usable, and I really enjoy showing it to people. The only real issue I ran into while adding code to the Google API application was some trouble with the resizing of the image to keep the resolution high, but that was solved by giving the application permission to write to external storage.
