This file is meant to describe what I did for the PA4 assignment since I can not figure out how to create a separate folder for it and because I edited old assignments instead of creating a new project. When I set out to do PA4, I originally wanted to edit and improve all three of the other projects, however I only ended up working on one of them, PA3. The changes I made were not extreme, but they were good quality of life improvements for the Google API application. I changed the code for the picture taking, using the high-resolution code that was given to us, including the ability to send the pictures to the phone's gallery as well. In addition to this, I added "Try again?" buttons on both end screens, the end screen for a successful guess and the one at the end of the unsuccessful guess path. These buttons bring the user back to the screen on which they open the camera to start using the application. I added these because previously the application would need to be closed in order to start the process again from the beginning. I have more ideas for this application as well as the other two, but did not get them implemented in time.
